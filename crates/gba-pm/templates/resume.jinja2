## Instructions

You are continuing work that was previously interrupted. Please:

1. **Assess Current State**: Check what has been completed by:
   - Reviewing the state file
   - Checking git status and recent commits
   - Examining any existing work in the worktree

2. **Continue Implementation**:
   - Resume from where the work was interrupted
   - Do NOT redo work that was already completed
   - Continue with the next logical step
   - Update the state file as progress is made

3. **Update State**: After each significant milestone, update the state file with:
   - Current phase and step
   - Turns completed
   - Cost incurred
   - Any completed work

## Important Notes

- The previous execution may have been interrupted mid-task
- Use git history to determine what was committed
- Uncommitted changes may indicate in-progress work
- Be conservative - if unsure whether something was completed, verify it before assuming
