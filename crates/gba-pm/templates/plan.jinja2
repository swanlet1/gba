## Feature Details

Feature ID: {{ feature_id }}
Description: {{ feature_description }}

## Repository Context

Main branch: {{ main_branch }}

## Instructions

Create a detailed implementation plan for this feature. The plan should:

1. Break down the work into logical phases (e.g., design, implementation, testing, documentation)
2. Each phase should have clear, actionable steps
3. Identify dependencies between phases
4. Estimate complexity for each phase
5. Identify potential risks or challenges
6. Specify what needs to be tested

The plan should be specific to this repository and the feature being implemented.
Consider the existing codebase structure, coding standards, and patterns already in use.
